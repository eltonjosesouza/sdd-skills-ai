# Tasks: Wizard Command

## Phase 1: Planning
- [x] T001 Create implementation plan for `wizard` command.

## Phase 2: Implementation (Core)
- [x] T002 Refactor existing command actions in `src/index.ts` into reusable named functions (`initAction`, `applySkillsAction`, `agentInitAction`, `specSkillsAddAction`).
- [x] T003 Implement `wizard` command in `src/index.ts` that prompts the user for each step and calls the corresponding action.
- [x] T004 [P] Build the CLI to verify correctness (`npm run build`).
